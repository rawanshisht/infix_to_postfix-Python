# infix_to_postfix-Python_code
a data structure code to convert infix into postfix using stack and queue in python

The code defines operations and assigns a key to each operation, splits the infix into tokens and starts in procedures' comparison. The avoidence of upper/lower case and 2 digits is in consideration.
